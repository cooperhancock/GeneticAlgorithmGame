Chromosome:

represented by 2d array of booleans which code for stand (false) or hit (true)
[] 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 (sum of player's hand)

Original Population:

each player will have a Chromosome of random genes (true or false)

Fitness:

pair off players to play through a certain number of games
player's fitness increases for each game they win up to the max of the number of total games

Crossover (mating) & Mutation:

select highest fitness individuals to reproduce the next generation

crossover genes from each parent to make child Chromosome

mutate certain percentage of genes 

(best way to do this may be to iterate through child Chromosome and select either mother, father, 
or random gene at that locus)


assemble children (and possibly some of the previous generation) into a new Population
rinse and repeat
